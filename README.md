# Development

Frontend is built on react.js and backend is built on Flask microservice. To start the development environment run

    docker-compose up -d frontend

This spins up two webservers for frontend (node) and backend (nginx). Open a browser and point to localhost:3000 for frontend, and localhost:8080 for backend.
